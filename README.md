## Pebble-app "Ruter - On the go"

### App description
Short desc: Get the closest Ruter-stops in Oslo and the realtime schedule. Easy.

Get the closest stops based on your current position, then fetch a time list of the next Bus, Train, Boat, Metro or Tram that arrives there. Just try it, I'm sure you'll appreciate it. This is a non official and non profit project by Tommy Gamst Vitikka. I found the need for an easy, on the go solution for checking which Ruter-stop was closest and finding when the next transportation would arrive. Using the Ruter API, this was quite a joy to accomplish. Give it a like if you find it useful! Successfully tested on Pebble Steel and Pebble Time. Norwegian and English language settings available.
