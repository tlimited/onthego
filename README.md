## Pebble-app "Ruter â€“ On the Go"

**Made my life easier on Pebble Steel. Past.**

### App description
Short desc: **Get the closest Ruter-stops in Oslo and the realtime schedule of those stops. Simply.**

Get the closest stops based on your current position, then fetch a time list of the next Bus, Train, Boat, Metro or Tram that arrives there. Just try it, I'm sure you'll appreciate it. This is a non official and non profit project by Tommy Gamst Vitikka. I found the need for an easy, on the go solution for checking which Ruter-stop was closest and finding when the next transportation would arrive. Using the Ruter API, this was quite a joy to accomplish. Give it a like if you find it useful! Successfully tested on Pebble Steel and Pebble Time. Norwegian and English language settings available.

### Pebble.js
So, this app is created purely with **javascript** with the beta **Pebble.js**-api. Tested and works really well with Pebble Steel and Pebble Time. Others seem to work quite allright too.

Main features is the use of **geolocation** and use of the **Ruter realtime API** through a xhr-request, and of course wrapping it up into a user friendly simple Pebble-styled UI.
